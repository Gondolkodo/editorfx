editorfx
========
This project is a simple plain text editor, that can open a folder and can access quickly all the files in the folder.

The main features: Open/Save/Close are implemented.

Currently needs a lot of details to create this project as a fully daily functional editor. But it does pretty well. It just get born as a test project, so if works... it's not bad :D

Needs JavaFX 2.
Test it in jdk1.7.0_09
